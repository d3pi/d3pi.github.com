#Using Android With Mac

1.Connecting Via USB
MTP protocol is not supported on Mac in default. In order to transfer files between mac and android device, we need to install [Android File Transfer](http://www.android.com/filetransfer/).

#Android Dev tools On Mac
1.[ADT Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) is a stable tools bundle for now, current version is v22.0.0-675183. 
-There are a little change from skd tools version 21 to version 22 , the third party library you imported has grouped in Android Private Library. When you open the old project in version 22, you will maybe get a wrong binary, because the third libary is not compiled into the apk. 
  Solution: open the project properties -> Java Build Path -> Order and Export, check the "Android Private Library".

-SVN plugin, subclipse and subversise, and the svn connectors are JavaHL and SVNKit. JavaHL is more steps to install, because it's jni library. And it's even worse on mac, because you need install homebrew or macports first.

2.[Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) is a new and better IDE based on IntelliJ.
